    1. Import all the neccesary libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.
    
    2. Imported both the data files containing ball by ball data and complete matches data.
    
    3. Did a bit of data cleaning by removing the null values and assigning some null values with certain data.
    
    4. Stated analysing the data by using pandas function like groupby, sort_values etc.
    
    5. Used concat and merge fuction wherever reguired.
    
    6. Used matplotlib and seaborn charts for the better understanding and visualisation of data
    
    7. Provided some of the conclusions based on the analysis at the end.
